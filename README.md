# Assignment Submission

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions for the Android assignments. I have completed:

1. **From Assignment Set 1:**
   - Q1: LRU Cache implementation
   - Q2: Custom HashMap implementation

2. **From Assignment Set 2:**
   - Q1: N-Queens problem solver
   - Q2: Circular dependency detector

## Note on Android Questions

I was unable to complete:
- Q3 from Set 1 (Book Review App)
- Q3 from Set 2 (Particle System)
- Q4 from Set 2 (WeatherTrack App)

**Reason:** While I have strong Java programming skills, I lack experience with Android-specific configurations and frameworks. I can write the core logic but struggled with the Android project setup and integration within the given timeframe.

## Solution Details

### Set 1 Solutions

1. **LRU Cache (Q1)**
   - Implemented using LinkedHashMap
   - O(1) time complexity for both get and put operations
   - Passes all given test cases

2. **Custom HashMap (Q2)**
   - Implemented with separate chaining collision resolution
   - Basic hash function with dynamic resizing
   - Supports put, get, and remove operations

### Set 2 Solutions

1. **N-Queens Problem (Q1)**
   - Backtracking solution
   - Returns all distinct solutions
   - Handles board sizes from 1 to 9

2. **Circular Dependency Detector (Q2)**
   - Graph-based solution using DFS
   - Handles self-dependencies
   - Works for disconnected graphs

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- Strong Java programming
- Data structures implementation
- Algorithm design (backtracking, graph algorithms)
- Problem-solving skills
- Clean code practices

## Future Improvements

I plan to:
1. Learn Android development fundamentals
2. Practice integrating Java logic with Android frameworks
3. Study common Android architectures (MVVM, Clean Architecture)
4. Explore Android-specific components (Room, ViewModel, LiveData)

## How to Run

Each solution is contained in its own Java file with a main method for testing. Simply compile and run the individual files.
